# 👋 Hi, I’m Christopher

I'm a software developer with a passion for building things that solve real problems — from automation scripts that save hours of manual work, to full-stack apps designed from scratch. I love the freedom that coding gives me to create whatever I imagine, and I’m always looking for ways to push the boundaries of what I can build.

Outside of code, I’ve been lifting weights for nearly 10 years and am currently prepping for my first bodybuilding competition. I’m also an avid reader with a current fixation on American history, and have a degree in English Literature from the College of New Jersey. No matter what I'm doing, I'm always looking for ways to improve my understanding of the world and expand my base of knowledge. 

## 🔧 Current Tech Interests
- Full-stack development (Node.js, PostgreSQL, vanilla HTML/CSS, React)
- Systems design and backend architecture
- Automation and workflow optimization
- Honestly? Anything and everything 

## 🛠️ Projects
Check out my pinned repositories for projects like:
- A full-stack coaches dashboard built for real-world use at a basketball training facility
- HubSpot and referral system automations that eliminated hours of weekly admin work
- More out there projects like my Donkey Kong watermarking app, and my Richard Nixon chatbot [in progress]

## 🧠 Things I'd Love to Learn More About
- Low level languages like C (would like to build an OS one day, as well as my own text editing software)
- and ASM (could make my own GBA and NES games, learn how to totally fry a motherboard)
- Automating IRL appliances like my coffee maker, or otherwise messing with appliances via code
- Simple hardware/electronics to tinker with in my garage
- Network Architecture & Digital Infrastructure to better understand how data moves across the internet
- Red Team & Blue Team practices to understand how that data is exploited / protected against
- Robotics because who doesn't like robots

## 📫 Contact
Feel free to reach out. I’m currently looking for a junior/entry-level dev role!
