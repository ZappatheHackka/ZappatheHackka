# Hi, I'm Chris

I'm a Python developer dedicated to writing software with purpose, depth, and craftsmanship. I’ve come to view coding as my craft, and as such I bring a combination of diligence and forward-thinking to my projects that elevates them beyond bottom-line functionality into robust, well-articulated pieces of software. From [open-source libraries](https://pypi.org/project/ft8decoder/) that make life easier for other developers to [automation scripts](https://github.com/ZappatheHackka/HubspotAutomation) that save hours of manual work, I love the freedom coding gives me to take ownership of any project I can imagine, all while being of service to others in the process. 

Outside of code, I’ve developed a nice itinerary of hobbies. I love to read literature (see my English degree) and history books, lift weights, and explore different types of music. Sometimes I play drums along to my favorite songs, too. 

## Current Tech Interests
Below are a few broad descriptions of the areas that interest me the most right now:
- Networking, sockets, how data is moved between machines (see my [mesh networking project](https://github.com/ZappatheHackka/py-netmesh)!) [in progress]
- Architecting data pipelines / backend systems (see my [PyPi library](https://github.com/ZappatheHackka/ft8decoder), as well as the above mesh networking project!)
- Automation and workflow optimization (see the HubSpot automation script above- saved me hours of work!)

## Other Projects
Check out my pinned repositories for projects like:
- A [full-stack coaches dashboard](https://github.com/ZappatheHackka/coachesdatabase) built for real-world use at a [basketball training facility](www.idhoops.com)
- HubSpot and referral system automations that eliminated hours of weekly admin work
- More frivolous but funny projects like my Donkey Kong watermarking app, and my Richard Nixon chatbot [in progress]

## Things I'd Love to Learn More About
- Network Architecture & Digital Infrastructure to better understand how data moves across the internet
- Malware (reverse engineering, making from scratch, etc.)
- Low level languages like C, C++, even ASM! 
- Automating IRL appliances like my coffee maker, or otherwise messing with appliances via code
- Simple hardware/electronics to tinker with in my garage

## Contact
Feel free to reach out. I’m currently looking for a junior/entry-level dev role!
