# 👋 Hi, I’m Christopher

I'm a software developer with a passion for building things that solve real problems — from automation scripts that save hours of manual work, to full-stack apps designed from scratch. I love the freedom that coding gives me to create whatever I imagine, and I’m always looking for ways to push the boundaries of what I can build.

Outside of code, I’ve been lifting weights for 10 years and I’m currently prepping for my first bodybuilding competition. I’m also a lifelong reader — especially drawn to history and philosophy — always trying to understand why the world works the way it does.

## 🔧 Tech Interests
- Automation and workflow optimization
- Full-stack development (Node.js, PostgreSQL, vanilla HTML/CSS)
- Systems design and backend architecture

## 🛠️ Projects
Check out my pinned repos for projects like:
- A coaches dashboard built for real-world use at a basketball training facility
- HubSpot and referral automations that eliminated hours of weekly admin work
- My Nixon fine-tuning experiment (because why not?)

## 📫 Contact
Feel free to reach out — I’m currently looking for a junior/entry-level dev role!
